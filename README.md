Hi.

I did in quite of a rush, as I am very busy at the momment. 

I was able to use the API for the IP, but my monthly usage expired. It worked for me, if you have an account that works you just need to change the key.

The files can be downloaded and tested locally. 

I did not worry about Responsive Design. So I would view on Desktop only.
